    As you take your final breath the monsters of the Dungeon rejoice.
    Your vision darkens as the Souls of those fallen before you weep in dismay.
    Though your Path ends here there a new Adventurere awaits to enter the dungeon.
    Guide them and learn from your mistakes. 
    And once the curse is lifted and you too can be free of the dungeon may the gods welcome your soul.

    The Dungeon has captured another soul.
